# Rice in Openbox based on Ubuntu 8.04

## I don't know if I did it, but this is based on Ubuntu 8.04

*I was 13 years old the first time I used Linux, now I'm 24 years old. I started with Ubuntu 8.04 because my computer in that time didn't support 10.04. The purpose of this theme is to remember the old Ubuntu.*

### Details:

OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
WM: Openbox
Panel: Polybar
Compositor: Ibhagwan's Picom Fork
Terminal: ST
